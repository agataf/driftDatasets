# driftDatasets

## Artificial:

#### [SEA Concepts] (https://github.com/vlosing/driftDatasets/tree/master/artificial/sea)
This dataset consists of 50000 instances with three attributes of which only two are relevant.
The two class decision boundary is given by f<sub>1</sub> + f<sub>2</sub> = b, where f<sub>1</sub>, f<sub>2</sub> are the two relevant features and b a predefined threshold.
Abrupt drift is simulated with four different concepts, by changing the value of b every 12500 samples.
Also included are 10\% of noise.

#### [Rotating Hyperplane] (https://github.com/vlosing/driftDatasets/tree/master/artificial/hyperplane)
A hyperplane in d-dimensional space is continuously changed in position and orientation continuous addition.
We used the Random Hyperplane generator in MOA with the same parametrization as in [PAW] (https://users.ics.aalto.fi/jesse/papers/article2_SAC.pdf) (10 dimensions, 2 classes, delta=0.001).

#### [Moving RBF] (https://github.com/vlosing/driftDatasets/tree/master/artificial/rbf)
Gaussian distributions with random initial positions, weights and standard deviations are moved with constant speed v in d-dimensional space. The weight controls the partitioning of the examples among the Gaussians.
We used the Random RBF generator in MOA with the same parametrization as in [PAW] (https://users.ics.aalto.fi/jesse/papers/article2_SAC.pdf) (10 dimensions, 50 Gaussians, 5 classes, v=0.001).

#### [Interchanging RBF] (https://github.com/vlosing/driftDatasets/tree/master/artificial/rbf)
Fifteen Gaussians with random covariance matrices are replacing each other every 3000 samples. Thereby, the number of Gaussians switching their position increases each time by one
until all are simultaneously changing their location. This allows to evaluate an algorithm in the context of abrupt drift with increasing strength. Altogether 67 abrupt drifts are occurring within this dataset.

#### [Moving Squares] (https://github.com/vlosing/driftDatasets/tree/master/artificial/movingSquares)
Four equidistantly separated, squared uniform distributions are moving in horizontal direction with constant speed. The direction is inverted whenever the leading square reaches a predefined boundary.
Each square represents a different class. 
The added value of this dataset is the predefined time horizon of 120 examples before old instances may start to overlap current ones. This is especially useful for dynamic sliding window approaches, allowing to test whether the size is adjusted accordingly.

#### [Transient Chessboard] (https://github.com/vlosing/driftDatasets/tree/master/artificial/chess)
Virtual drift is generated by revealing successively parts of a chessboard. This is done square by square randomly chosen from the whole chessboard such that each square represents an own concept. 
Every time after four fields have been revealed, samples covering the whole chessboard are presented. 
This reoccurring alternation penalizes algorithms tending to discard former concepts. To reduce the impact of classification by chance we used eight classes instead of two.

#### [Mixed Drift] (https://github.com/vlosing/driftDatasets/tree/master/artificial/mixedDrift)
The datasets Interchanging RBF, Moving Squares and Transient Chessboard are arranged next to each other and samples of these are alternately introduced.
Therefore, incremental, abrupt and virtual drift are occurring at the same time, requiring a local adaptation to different drift types.
